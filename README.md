# ML_Arena
Unity Project. A small FPS arena game where you can fight an AI trained by a neural network.

The controlls are simple. WASD to move.  move your mouse to rotate (only horizontal), and left mouse button to shoot. Avoid the red zones on the ground because they will damage you.

There isn't really any feedback when you take damage, as this is a simple tech demo for an AI trained by a neural network.
